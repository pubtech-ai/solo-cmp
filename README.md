## Development Flow

All development work occurs on the `develop` branch.
The `main` branch is used to create new releases by merging current head of the `develop` branch.
You should create a feature-branch, branching from `develop`, whenever you need to add some changes to the `main` branch.
If those changes are accepted they will be merged by the repository maintainer.
